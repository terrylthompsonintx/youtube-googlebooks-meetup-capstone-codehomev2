## Background
The page is a one stop site where the user can learn about a subject either through Youtube or to search Google Books for books on that subject or find a Meetup.

## User Cases
* As a user I want to understand how I can use the site.
* On load the user will see a banner explaining the site's purpose.
* The user will be able to select from pre-made queries.
* In the head section of the page the user will be able to push a button to select youtube, Google Books, or Meetup.  They can switch from any resource without having to enter a new query.
* On selection of Youtube, a list of videos regarding that subject will be available.
* On selection of Google books, a list of books will be available.
* On selection of Meetup, a map with meetups will be available.

## Working Prototype
You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://terrylthompsonintx.github.io/youtube-googlebooks-meetup-learn-coding-capstone/

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* Search for several pre-selected subjects on web developement.
* The app returns information information from three different sites on the subject.
* The user can toggle between returns for YouTube, Google Books, and Meetup.
* The user can select a new subject.


## Technology

*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript
*jQuery
*Ajax

## Responsive
App is built to be responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:

* Embedding content in the lower section of screen. I.E.  the user selects an item and instead of opening in a new tab, it opens in the lower section of page.
* Pagination of returns; currently there is a limited number of displayed returns regardless of how many are returned from API.   Ideally
  if there are more returns than one page, the user can select to go to the next set of returns.
* Add an option for the user to enter a query rather than to select a pre-existing one.
